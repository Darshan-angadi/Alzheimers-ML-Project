# Alzheimers-ML-Project
Predicting and Classifying alzheimer's disease using biomarkers


# Project: Alzheimer's Disease Classification (ML)

This is a simple machine learning project using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle to classify Alzheimer’s Disease vs. Mild Cognitive Impairment vs. Healthy. It’s aimed at beginners and focuses on reproducibility and transparency, taking lessons from past failed ML cohorts.

# Goal:
Train and evaluate basic ML models (like logistic regression and random forests) while documenting every step: from data cleaning to evaluation.

# Setup

Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Alzheimers-ML-Project.git

Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Download dataset from Kaggle and place in data/ folder.

Run notebooks or scripts in order.
